+ delete PIN-locked places only after entering PIN

Changes in `home_screen.dart`:
1. Function `deletePlace` (line 128-138): added PIN check before delete confirmation dialog
2. Swipe left (Dismissible): now calls `deletePlace` instead of separate logic - ensures:
   - PIN check for locked lists
   - Correct photo handling on delete

Now when trying to delete a PIN-locked list (via menu or swipe), PIN dialog appears first, and only after correct input - delete confirmation dialog.
